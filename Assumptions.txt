//// RULES ////

Flush
A flush is any hand with five cards of the same suit. If two or more players hold a flush, 
the flush with the highest card wins. 
If more than one player has the same strength high card, then the strength of the 
second highest card held wins. 
This continues through the five highest cards in the player's hands.

Three of a Kind
If more than one player holds three of a kind, 
then the higher value of the cards used to make the three of kind determines the winner. 
If two or more players have the same three of a kind, 
then a fourth card (and a fifth if necessary) can be used as kickers to determine the winner.

One Pair
If two or more players hold a single pair, then highest pair wins. 
If the pairs are of the same value, the highest kicker card determines the winner. 
A second and even third kicker can be used if necessary.

High Card
When no player has even a pair, then the highest card wins.
 When both players have identical high cards, the next highest card wins,
 and so on until five cards have been used.
 In the unusual circumstance that two players hold the identical five cards,
the pot would be split.
